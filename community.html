		<h1>NYC Coffee Shop Network</h1>
		<div class="coffee-shop-network">
			<h2>Better Together</h2>
			<p>King's street is part of a network of coffee shops around Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island city. 
			Together, our shops are committed to making quality coffee, sourcing ethically, paying employees an excellent wage, and uplifting
			other small businesses in our local community. Our shops often host cross-shop pop-ups and events for good local causes and share best practices
			regarding sustainability, inclusion, and all-things coffee.
			We believe the saying that if you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together. 
			Each shop on this list has a different vibe, a different menu, and a beautiful approach to coffee and community. 
			When you get a chance, explore the coffee offerings and the surrounding neighborhoods of these amazing sister spots. 
			Just remember to come back!
			</p>

			<h3>Here to Help</h3>
			<p>If you or someone you know is experiencing food insecurity, every Wednesday evening, all of the coffee shops in our network set aside a portion of our food inventory and make it available to anyone who is experiencing hunger. 
				The food is free of charge and you do not need to disclose any personal information to take some. 
				Just stop in any Wednesday between 5pm and 6pm and look for the dedicated grab-and-go bins near the front door.
				If the bin is empty during this time, just let the one of our staff members know and we will take care of it. 
				Finally, all of our cafesâ€™ staff are knowledgeable in housing, food, and safety resources in their local area. 
				If you are feeling unsafe or need help, they will be more than happy to point you to the nearest resource. </p>
