			<h3> Reviews by our Customers</h3>
			<h4>What a cute coffee shop!</h4>
			<p>Came here with a friend, craving something caffeinated before we braved the city. 
			You walk in and are immediately greeted by plants! Honestly, livened up the seating area. 
			We placed our order with a very helpful barista: my friend ordered a mocha, I ordered an oat milk latte and an almond croissant.
			The oatmilk latte was wonderful. The espresso was smooth and despite not being traditional milk, 
			the latte was still luxurious and creamy! The almond croissant was not too sweet and you could
			tell it was very fresh. My friend enjoyed her mocha as well.
			Will definitely being coming back next time to sit for the afternoon!</p>
			
			<h4>A great place to hang out</h4>
			<p>Very nice down to earth coffee shop with lots of greenery. Nice beige walls and lots of natural 
				light give this coffee shop a warm and comfortable feel. 
				Usually I'm pretty hesitant to get flavored hot coffee, lattes, cappuccinos, etc... 
				Heard King's street makes their own syrups so figured I'd try the caramel syrup latte.  
				Honestly it was very good and not too sweet, seriously a well crafted latte.
				They use coffee from Joe Coffee, which is a really quality roaster. 
				They also have ample seating and a bathroom making it a nice spot to hang out and do some work.!</p>
